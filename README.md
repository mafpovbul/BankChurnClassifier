# CreditCardChurnClassifier

In this project, I aim to generate various classifier models to predict whether a customer of a bank will "attrite"/churn based on the set of input features present in the dataset. I will then compare the performances of the 4 models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB)) using their precision and recall scores, as well as their ROC curves.
